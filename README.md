# sharex-configs
Sharex configurations (sxcu files) for websites that use Zendesk
To use these, simply download a file and open it while you have sharex open, sharex should detect the file and ask if you want to isntall it
obviously some might not work, but at the time of creating this repo they all work and i tested them, feel free to contact me if one stops functioning
